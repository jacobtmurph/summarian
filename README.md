# Summarian

Summarian is a place where **you** can find and submit spoiler-free book summaries on your favourite titles.

## Summarian is also open-source, so you can get involved to help make the website better.

You could make a native client, that utilizes our internal `/api` routes, or just submit fixes to the actual website itself!

### To get started
 1. Make sure you have node, npm, and a local mongo instance installed.
 2. Clone this repo.
 3. Install the dependancies via `npm i`
 4. Dig around!

 If you find any improvements to be made:
 
 ### Try your hand at it, then submit a pull request.
 
 And that's it!

 We look forward to reading your summaries, and commits!
